* This is **Module Planning App project for NUS students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a personalised module planner for an NUS student
  * as a platform to check whether graduation criteria is met
* The project allows NUS students to be able to plan for their modules to take in their future semesters by ensuring that their pre-requisites are met and that the modules taken are able to meet their graduation requirements.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `NUSchedule` (`NUSch` for short) because it was initially created as a part of a series of `AddressBook` projects (`Level 1`, `Level 2`, `Level 3` ...).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Address Book Product Website](https://se-education.org/adressbook-level3)**.

* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
* It allows students to check their current MCs with the command `Show MCs`, as well as calculate their CAP (cumulative academic points) with command `Show cap`
